# **App Name**: AgriSprayer AI

## Core Features:

- AI Assistant Integration: Integrate a multilingual (English/Hindi) AI assistant that can be queried via voice or text to provide contextual farming advice, weather updates, and field conditions. This assistant will use a tool to intelligently retrieve the context of a conversation and personalize responses based on historical data.
- Simulated Drone Control Interface: Provide a UI to control a simulated drone with features to takeoff, scan, spray, return, and display real-time telemetry. Enable the emergency stop functionality for simulated emergencies.
- Disease Detection Demo: Simulate plant disease detection using uploaded crop images and displaying a confidence score (Healthy/Mild/Severe). Offer geotagged mapping with boundary creation on a field to visualize affected areas.
- Treatment Scheduling and Execution Tracking: Enable users to schedule treatment plans based on AI-driven disease detection results, manage treatment logs, and track execution progress. The tool should adapt recommendations for fertilizer blends based on current crop and environmental status.
- Farmer Registration and Field Setup: Develop a farmer registration system and a field setup workflow, where farmers can add fields, specify GPS coordinates, and define crop types. Field data is cached to be available offline.
- Admin Dashboard: Create a dashboard for admins to manage farmer accounts, drone fleets, usage analytics, and treatment history. Admins can generate reports and monitor system performance. Includes multiple user management options.
- Offline Data Caching: Implement offline data caching for fields, treatments, and weather forecasts, using local storage. This ensures the app remains functional in areas with poor connectivity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest Green (#388E3C), representing growth, nature, and agriculture. This conveys a sense of health and sustainability.
- Background color: Light Beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral and earthy backdrop that evokes farmland. This muted tone ensures readability and reduces eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Golden Yellow (#FFC107), used sparingly for key interactive elements and highlights. Symbolizes the harvest and attracts user attention to critical calls to action without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet warm and easily readable experience on various devices.
- Use clean, vector-based icons that are intuitive and representative of agricultural concepts. Ensure icons are consistent in style and visually accessible.
- Implement a mobile-first, responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations. Use card-based designs for content modules, and prioritize critical data for quick access. The mobile experience must accommodate smaller screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle, meaningful animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., loading animations, transitions). Avoid unnecessary animations that may distract or slow down the user.
